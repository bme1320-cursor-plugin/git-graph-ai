    This report details the design and implementation of ``IntelliDiff,'' a Cursor extension that supercharges the popular Git Graph plugin with Artificial Intelligence. The primary goal of this project is to simplify the understanding of complex Git histories by providing intelligent, automated analysis of code changes. Key features include AI-powered summaries for commits, comparisons between different versions, and in-depth analysis of a single file's evolution over time. To ensure a fluid user experience and mitigate the inherent latency of AI models, the extension implements a sophisticated architecture featuring asynchronous processing for non-blocking UI updates and a two-tier caching system (memory and disk) to dramatically reduce response times and API costs on repeated analyses. This project demonstrates a practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance developer productivity and streamline code review processes.
